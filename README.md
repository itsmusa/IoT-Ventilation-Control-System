# Remotely Controlled Ventilation System

## Project Overview

This project introduces a remotely controlled ventilation system powered by the Internet of Things (IoT) and fuzzy logic. Designed to optimize indoor environmental conditions, the system automatically monitors and adjusts temperature and humidity levels in real-time. A user-friendly web interface provides live feedback and control, enhancing comfort and energy efficiency. Applications range from homes and server rooms to greenhouses and industrial facilities.

## Installation

### Requirements

- **Microcontroller:** Raspberry Pi Pico W  
- **Sensors:** DHT11 (Temperature and Humidity)  
- **Fan Driver:** L298N Motor Driver  
- **Storage:** microSD Card + Module  
- **Power:** 12V for fans, 5V for Pico W

### Software Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the web UI)
- MATLAB (for fuzzy logic simulation)
- CallMeBot API access (for notifications)

### Setup Steps

1. **Hardware Assembly:**
   - Connect DHT11 sensors and DC fans to the Pico W.
   - Use L298N to control fan speed.
   - Set up the microSD card module with SPI.

2. **Flashing Code:**
   - Write the Python control algorithm to the Pico W using Thonny or equivalent.
   - Include fuzzy logic-based control, data logging, and communication modules.

3. **Web Interface:**
   - Host HTML/CSS/JavaScript files on the Pico W.
   - Configure the server to serve live sensor data and graphs.

4. **Power Supply:**
   - Ensure 12V supply for fans and 5V regulated power for Pico W.

## Usage

### System Operation

```python
# Pseudocode for basic operation
read_temperature_humidity()
fuzzy_logic_control()
adjust_fan_speed()
log_data_to_sd()
update_web_dashboard()
```

### Accessing the Dashboard

1. Connect to the same Wi-Fi network as the Pico W.
2. Open a browser and navigate to the Pico Wâ€™s IP address.
3. View live readings, control fan behavior, and check historical data.

### Retrieving Stored Data

- Eject the microSD card from the unit.
- Use a card reader to access `.txt` logs from any PC.
