# IoT-Ventilation-Control-System
This IoT-based ventilation control system uses fuzzy logic to adjust fan speed based on temperature and humidity. Powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico W, it enables wireless communication and hosts a web interface for remote monitoring and control. Written in Python, itâ€™s ideal for greenhouses, IoT projects focused on environmental management.
